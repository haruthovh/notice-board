Here I have done only point in MUST and first of optionals, to complete ASAP, But I can do optional points as well, just let me know if needed.
F.ex. use events/listeners to send email after creating new story, Write service to manage all actions in stories and call that methods from controller, Cache initial stories, etc.

I used jQuery for this task, But I can develop using Vue.js as well.

For fetching stories without refreshing browser, I used jQuery ajax that will be sent once per 5 seconds, but if I had more time I will do this using websockets.
